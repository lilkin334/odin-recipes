Hello!

For this project, I am demonstrating the skills I have learned through the Odin Foundations course about HTML. I should be using links, images, paragraphs, and other various tools to effictively create a base HTML recipe website. I am hoping my website is functional and the layout is user friendly. Later, I will be writing a self reflection at the conclusion of this project highlighting any thoughts or concerns about my knowledge of HTML. (:

After completing the project, I feel I have a decent base understanding of HTML. My biggest weakness is understanding the concept of relative paths, but I feel I can make them functional at the very least. This project was insightful, and a great summary of the HTML foudnations course.
